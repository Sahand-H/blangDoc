## Improving build pipeline

- [ ] Import of bayonet - change of plan: just copy stuff over
- [ ] Upgrade everything to v.10
- [ ] Publish so as to have other projects using it
- [ ] See if can get rid of some other config files (in particular, maven ones)

Things to test in the meanwhile / maintain:

1. gradle command line headless builds
2. eclipse plug-in and/or child instance
3. test from IDE


## Flesh out more doc

- [ ] Include notes from the blangDSL
- [ ] Point the ``README.md`` in blangDSL to this repo
- [ ] Language specs
- [ ] Skeleton for more doc, etc.
