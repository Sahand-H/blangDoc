## Improving build pipeline

- [x] Import of bayonet - change of plan: just copy stuff over
- [x] Upgrade everything to v.10
- [x] Publish so as to have other projects using it
- [x] See if can get rid of some other config files (in particular, maven ones) -> No, removing the .pom and .build breaks running child eclipse
- [ ] Document
- [ ] Reserve lab
- [ ] Start integration with Silico

Things to test in the meanwhile / maintain:

1. gradle command line headless builds
2. eclipse plug-in and/or child instance
3. test from IDE


## Flesh out more doc

- [ ] Include notes from the blangDSL
- [x] How to deploy
- [ ] Project organization
- [ ] Point the ``README.md`` in blangDSL to this repo
- [ ] Language specs
- [ ] Skeleton for more doc, etc.
